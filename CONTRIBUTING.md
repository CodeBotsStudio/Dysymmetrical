### Quick note

Read [Quick Note](https://github.com/CodeBotsStudio/Dysymmetrical/wiki/0.-Getting-Started#quick-note), [Required VSCode Extensions](https://github.com/CodeBotsStudio/Dysymmetrical/wiki/0.-Getting-Started#required-vscode-extensions) and [Recommended VSCode Extensions](https://github.com/CodeBotsStudio/Dysymmetrical/wiki/0.-Getting-Started#recommended-vscode-extensions) from [0. Getting Started](https://github.com/CodeBotsStudio/Dysymmetrical/wiki/0.-Getting-Started).

Also know that I'll refer to **Pull Requests** as **PRs**.

### Creating the PR's repository

First, go to [Dysymmetrical's repository](https://github.com/CodeBotsStudio/Dysymmetrical) and click the button labeled `Fork` at the top right.

![1ForkButton](dysdocs/contributing/1ForkButton.png)

Then, leave everything as is *except* for the name, that'll be named after a summary of 1-3 words of your changes (it can literally be named whatever you want but yeah).

![2ForkCreation](dysdocs/contributing/2ForkCreation.png)

In GitHub Desktop, clone the repository you just created in your local machine (PC) and open it with VSCode. Then, set it up like it says in [0. Getting Started](https://github.com/CodeBotsStudio/Dysymmetrical/wiki/0.-Getting-Started).

![3ForkClone](dysdocs/contributing/3ForkClone.png)

When you get prompted with what you'll use the fork for, indicate that it's for contributing to the parent project.

![4ForkSettings](dysdocs/contributing/4ForkSettings.png)

When you've done your changes and commits, go to your GitHub page and click `Contribute`, then `Open Pull Request`.

![5PROpen](dysdocs/contributing/5PROpen.png)

Name your PR and describe what you've done in its description, then hit `Create Pull Request`.

![6PRSettings](dysdocs/contributing/6PRSettings.png)

After this, your PR will be reviewed and maybe merged into the main branch. You'll also get a thank you. :>

When your PR has been closed, you can remove the PR's repository from your account if you want to.
