## DISCLAIMER
NO CODE or ESSENTIAL UI is being stolen from Forsaken.
There are certain assets from Forsaken used in this project's UI but they're nothing major and WILL be replaced soon.

## Getting Started
Read [Getting Started](https://github.com/CodeBotsStudio/Dysymmetrical/wiki/0.-Getting-Started) in the wiki.

## Bug reporting
If you find a certain bug in the engine, it'd be really appreciated if you reported it in the GitHub Issues page for this repo.

If you're able to fix it by yourself, it'd also be a great help if you opened a pull request fixing the issue.

Read `Contributing` below for more information.

## Documentation
Docs for anything added in the engine can be found through code comments at the start of important variables or functions. Any of those that isn't considered important outside of being used internally doesn't have any.

A proper docs page may be made if the project gets too big.

No one's stopping anyone from reading the code by themselves and changing it, though.

For animations, there are templates for Blender in `dysassets\Blend Files`.
