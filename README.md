## DISCLAIMER
NO CODE or ESSENTIAL UI is being stolen from Forsaken.
There are certain assets from Forsaken used in this project's UI but they're nothing major and WILL be replaced soon.

## Getting Started
Read [Getting Started](https://github.com/CodeBotsStudio/Dysymmetrical/wiki/0.-Getting-Started) in the wiki.

## Bug reporting
If you find a certain bug in the engine, it'd be really appreciated if you reported it in the GitHub Issues page for this repo.

If you're able to fix it by yourself, it'd also be a great help if you opened a pull request fixing the issue.

Read `Contributing` below for more information.

## Documentation
Docs for anything added in the engine can be found through code comments at the start of important variables or functions. Any of those that isn't considered important outside of being used internally doesn't have any.

A proper docs page may be made if the project gets too big.

No one's stopping anyone from reading the code by themselves and changing it, though.

For animations, there are templates for Blender in `dysassets\Blend Files`.

## Contributing
Contributing's such a simple topic that it isn't in its own separate file.

You may create pull requests of anything you want changed from the engine as long as it benefits anyone (e.g. a QoL feature or a bug fix).

They will be read and checked to see if they deserve to be merged.

If you add utils to `ReplicatedStorage/Modules/CommonUtils` or `ServerScriptService/System/CommonFunctions`,
it'd be greatly appreciated if you could add them to the engine's repo through a pull request.
Credits would be given in the util's documentation.

To-Do's are listed through comments as well, so you might want to install something like [Todo+](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus) in VSCode to see every `NOTE`, `FIXME`, `TODO`...

If you *do* indeed make a pull request, it'll most probably be revised and merged without many questions or complaints.
Though, if it's needed, the stuff in the pull requests will be changed if it doesn't comply with W.I.P. features or with the code style itself.

## Licensing
You may use this project for whatever you want, as long as you keep credit.
Do NOT remove the `print()` calls that identify this engine.
If you do, leave the engine credits in the game's description or in the credits menu in the lobby's sidebar.
